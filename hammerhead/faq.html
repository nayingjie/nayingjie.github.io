              <h5 class="center">I only race for fun, why do I need a website?</h5>
              <p class="light">You aren’t alone. Most teams that race are in the “grassroots” level, race as a hobby. Or a group of individuals just want to race for the love of the sport. However, that doesn’t pay the bills. Unless you’re independently wealthy or take out a second mortgage on the house, you probably have a few marketing partners on your vehicle somewhere. A website is an excellent way to help promote your marketing partners. A digital presence can help you pull ahead of your competition in the race for sponsorship. Of all the racers nationwide, only a small percentage have a digital presence.</p>

              <h5 class="center">I can't afford to spend money on a website.</h5>
              <p class="light">You can’t afford not to have a website! Too many racers focus on what they need to go faster and win the race. I’ll tell you what you need - a lot, and I mean a lot, of money. If you talk to racers at your local track who are top five in points or win features on a regular basis, you’ll find some are ashamed of what they are spending to stay on top. Then take a look at their car. Is it sponsored? You bet! Do they have a website? More than likely. Hammerhead Promotions basic sites can cost as little as $375 with hosting included for the 1st year! That’s probably equivalent a few new tires (which will be gone in a matter of weeks). A website will last as long as your team does. Plus, you can upgrade or redesign whenever you want!</p>

              <h5 class="center">What can a website do for my team?</h5>
              <p class="light">- A website is an inexpensive way to reach new marketing partners and extend your fan base. For example, a few potential marketing partners visit your local speedway. They need a new way to reach customers, and think racing is the perfect tool. Regardless of how you’re running on the track, you’re the only driver with a website displayed on their car. They don’t have time to visit the pits but jot down your web address. The next day your phone rings with a possible marketing partner on the line. And bam - you have yourself a new marketing partner.
              <p class="light">- By changing or updating the content on your site on a regular basis, you encourage return visitors which means extra visibility for your marketing partners. This keeps their products fresh in their mind and your fans in their stores. A win-win proposition!</p>
              <p class="light">- Most individuals who are online earn a moderate income and are ready to buy products. Having a website develops a link to a worldwide audience of consumers.</p>
              <p class="light">- A website will provide a 24/7 communication pipeline between you and your marketing partners - and your loyal fans.</p></p>

              <h5 class="center">What can't a website do?</h5>
              <p class="light">A website is just like a tool - it needs to be used correctly to get the job done.
              <p class="light">- A website can't make sponsorships magically appear.</p>
              <p class="light">- You won't automatically start winning races when you get a website.</p>
              <p class="light">- A website doesn't allow just anybody to find your race team effortlessly. You still have to reach out - don't expect them to stumble across your site.</p></p>

              <h5 class="center">How do your sites differ from other people's?</h5>
              <p class="light">It’s a matter of focus. One primary goal on the racetrack is focus. Lose it, and you will likely lose the race. Worse yet, a loss of focus could result in a wreck and injure you or other drivers. The same holds true on the internet. Not only is it important to keep ahead of the competition, but loss of focus results in poor design, useless animations, distracting information and lack of return visitors, which can permanently cripple a website. Professionally designed interfaces and team logos can help you leave your competition in the dust. You only get one chance at a first impression - so don't blow it!</p>
              <p class="light">Potential marketing partners are looking to the internet to judge a race team’s credibility and level of professionalism. Your website is a reflection of that professionalism and your dedication to your racing. Too many novices volunteer to design a website for a team without realizing the ramifications of their “mickey mouse” designs. You need a site that grabs the attention of the viewer and won’t let go. Don’t leave the financial security of your race team to some design company that thinks racing is “just a bunch of cars going around in circles.”</p>

              <h5 class="center">What makes a website professional?</h5>
              <p class="light">That’s a matter of opinion, but at Hammerhead Promotions we feel there are too many racing team sites geared toward its members or fans. This isn’t necessarily bad, but a potential marketing partner could have some difficulty. We look at design from their perspective first and the fans second. Because when push comes to shove, who’s paying the bills? This is why it is crucial that your site designer has the correct perspective. Marketing partners and fans are our lifeblood and some designers just don’t understand that dynamic. All you get from them is an inflated bill!
              <p class="light">Navigation through a site is another critical issue in professional design. How easy can a potential sponsor navigate around your site? Can they get lost and just decide to leave? If so, that will cost you visitors in the long run.</p>
